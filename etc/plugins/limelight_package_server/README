LimelightPackageServer
======================

This plugin provides the capability to easily serve up Limelight packages.  The
only configuration is a method call from the controller that you want to be 
responsible for serving .llp files.  The plugin will then respond to the download
action on the controller.  The download action looks for a param called package.  
This is used to determine the location of the directory that will be packaged.
If the requested package is not found, a 404 response is sent to the client.


Example
=======

class DownloaderController < ApplicationController
	serve_limelight_packages :production_path => "/path/to/limelight/productions/"
end

url_for(:controller => "downloader", :action => "download", :package => "MyLimelightPackage")
