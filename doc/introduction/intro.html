		<h3>Dynamic Rich Client Framework</h3>
		Limelight is a rich client GUI framework unlike any other.  With a unique angle on GUI development, Limelight harnesses the power to
		develop a wide range of applications from business tools to games.
		
		<h3>Web-Like Look &amp; Feel</h3>
		Web apps are prolific and everyone knows how to use them.  Limelight takes advantage of this fact producing UIs with a Web-Like Look
		&amp; Feel. Websites can be cloned by Limelight and the two would be indistinguishable. 
		
		<h3>One Language</h3>
		Unlike many other frameworks, Limelight applications are built using only one language: Ruby.  Every aspect, from the screen structure 
		and styling, to control logic and business modeling, is written in Ruby.
		
		<h3>Simple, Fast Development</h3>
		Limelight has been streamlined to be simple and easy to work with.  Its APIs have been molded such that development requires minimal
		syntax and NO duplication.  Consequently, the APIs are a breeze to learn and development is blazingly fast. 
		
		<h3>Unique Theater Metaphor</h3>
		Let's face it, plain app apps don't cut is any more.  These days, users have to be thrilled and entertained.  Limelight promotes this
		attitude to the core.  In Limelight you don't build applications, you build theatrical Productions.  Limelight provides a Theater in which
		you open Scenes, build Props, and cast Players to bring your Production to life and razzle-dazzle your audience.
		
		<h3>Cross Platform</h3>
		Limelight, built on Java, can be ported to all major systems.
		
		<h3>Open Source</h3>
		Limelight is Free and Open Source.  It is distributed under the TBD license.
