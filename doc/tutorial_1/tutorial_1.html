					Styles define the way Props look.  We've already been applying Styles to the Props by setting the 
					width, height, and background_color.  But putting the styles inside the <code>props.rb</code> file
					can get messy.  Let's pull the Styles out of <code>props.rb</code> and add a few more.

					Enter the following text in <code>styles.rb</code>:
<pre>backdrop {
  background_color "black"
  width "100%"
  height "100%"
}

sample {
  width 100
  height 100
}

selection {
  width 300
  height 300
  background_color "gray" 
}</pre>				
					And edit <code>props.rb</code> to remove all the Styles:
<pre>backdrop do
  %w{ red orange yellow green blue magenta }.each do |color|
    sample :background_color => color, :text => color
  end
  selection :id => "the_selection"
end</pre>				
					After refreshing the Scene, it will look exactly the same.<br/>
					<br/>
					What we've done here is create 3 Style objects with the names <code>backdrop</code>, <code>sample</code>, and <code>selection</code>.
					Limelight will load these Styles automatically and apply them to Props based on their names.

					Now, we could really make better use of the Scene's real estate.  Update the <code>backdrop</code> 
					and <code>sample</code> Styles in <code>styles.rb</code> like so:
<pre>backdrop {
  background_color "black"
  width "100%"
  height "100%"
  horizontal_alignment "center"
  vertical_alignment "center"
}

sample {
  width 100
  height 100
  margin 5
  horizontal_alignment "center"
  vertical_alignment "center"
  font_size "18"
  font_style "bold"
  text_color "white"
}</pre>				
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="20"></td>
				<td>
					In the <code>backdrop</code> Style, we added horizontal and vertical alignment, setting both to <code>center</code>.  
					This, in effect, tells the <code>backdrop</code> Prop to center all of it children Props horizontally and vertically.  
					We did the same to the <code>sample</code> Style, but in this case, the text is centered.<br/>
					In the <code>sample</code> we also added a little margin the space the Props out and specified some text changes.</br>
					Refresh and you should see a window like the one on the right.

					When a Scene is loaded, all of the Players in the <code>players</code> directory are loaded as well.
					When a Player exists for a Prop by the same name, Limelight will all the Player's behavior to the Prop.
					In this case, the <code>sample</code> Props, having been invigorated with the <code>Sample</code> Player, 
					will not respond to mouse clicks.<br/>
					<br/>
					Let's look at the <code>mouse_clicked</code> method defined in the <code>Sample</code> Player.  Remember 
					that we gave the <code>selection</code> Prop an id?  Well that's coming in handy here because we can now 
					search for that Prop in the Scene using the <code>find</code> method.  Then we access the <code>selection</code>
					Prop's style and set its background color the the color of the <code>sample</code> Prop that was clicked.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now, after refreshing, every time you click a <code>sample</code> Prop, the <code>selection</code> Prop will
					change color.
