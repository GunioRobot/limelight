            <span class="title">What is Limelight?</span>
            <span class="text">Limelight is a rich client GUI framework unlike any other.  With a unique angle on GUI development, Limelight harnesses the power to
            develop a wide range of applications from business tools to games.</span>

            <span class="title">One Language</span>
            <span class="text">Unlike many other frameworks, Limelight applications are built using only one language: Ruby.  Every aspect, from the screen structure
            and styling, to control logic and business modeling, is written in Ruby.</span>

            <span class="title">Unique Theater Metaphor</span>
            <span class="text">Let's face it, plain app apps don't cut is any more.  These days, users have to be thrilled and entertained.  Limelight promotes this
            attitude to the core.  In Limelight you don't build applications, you build theatrical Productions.  Limelight provides a Theater in which
            you open Scenes, build Props, and cast Players to bring your Production to life and razzle-dazzle your audience.</span>
          </td>
          <td width="50%" valign="top">
            <span class="title">Web-Like Look &amp; Feel</span>
            <span class="text">Web apps are prolific and everyone knows how to use them.  Limelight takes advantage of this fact producing UIs with a Web-Like Look
            &amp; Feel. Websites can be cloned by Limelight and the two would be indistinguishable.</span>

            <span class="title">Simple, Fast Development</span>
            <span class="text">Limelight has been streamlined to be simple and easy to work with.  Its APIs have been molded such that development requires minimal
            syntax and no duplication.  Consequently, the APIs are a breeze to learn and development is blazingly fast. </span>

            <span class="title">Cross Platform</span>
            <span class="text">Limelight, built on Java, can be ported to all major systems.</span>

            <span class="title">Open Source</span>
            <span class="text">Limelight is Free and Open Source.  It is distributed under the TBD license.</span>
