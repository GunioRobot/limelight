      # A Builtin Player that adds the look and behavior of a native radio button.  It may be applied in the PropBuilder DSL
      # like so:
      #
      #   my_radio_button :players => "radio_button", :id => "radio1", :group => "my_radio_button_group"
      #
      # When including this Player, it's important to specify a group and id.  All radio buttons in the same group will
      # be mutually exclusive.  The value of a radio button group will be the id of the selected radio button.
      #
      # Props including this Player may implement the button_pressed hook.
      #
      #   def button_pressed(e)
      #     # do something
      #   end
      #
      # Props including this Player may implement any of the key and focus event hooks:
      #
      #   key_pressed, key_typed, key_released, focus_gained, focus_lost
